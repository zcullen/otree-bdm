<p>A few months back, you completed a survey, as part of a transcription task. Here is one of the questions you were asked:</p>
<hr>

<p><i>You will be given the choice between being paid for completing a page of transcription at 95% accuracy within 48 hours, or receiving $9 without having to do any transcription, also 48 hours from now.</i></p>

<p>As promised, we have randomly selected one of the questions you answered, the selected question is:</p>
<p><i>Which would you prefer?</i></p>
<p><i>${{qno5}}, for 5 pages transcribed (${{qno}} per page, 95% accuracy) or $9, no transcription required

<p>Your MTUrk ID is  {{ wid }} and you chose to{% if niner %} take the $9, and not perform any transcription. {% else %} perform the 5 pages of transcriptions for ${{qno5}}.{% endif %}</p>

<p>The transcription part, for the bonus, can be done any time in the next 48 hours.</p>
